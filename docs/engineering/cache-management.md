# Cache Management & Invalidation

## Cache Structure on SD Card

**Location**: `.crosspoint/` directory on SD card root

**Structure**:
- EPUB: `.crosspoint/epub_<hash>/{book.bin, progress.bin, cover.bmp, thumb_<height>.bmp, sections/*.bin}`
- XTC: `.crosspoint/xtc_<hash>/{cover.bmp, thumb_<height>.bmp}`
- TXT: `.crosspoint/txt_<hash>/{index.bin, chapters.bin, progress.bin}`

`recent.json` stores the theme-neutral `thumb_[HEIGHT].bmp` path template for
EPUB and XTC entries. Home themes replace `[HEIGHT]` with their requested
thumbnail height. Lyra Carousel redirects only its in-memory `RecentBook` copy
to `cover.bmp`, generating that full cover when missing; switching themes must
not replace the persisted template.

When an EPUB has no `book.bin`, thumbnail generation first builds metadata but
continues to skip CSS. Inx resolves each target and compatibility thumbnail at
most once per Activity, displays the existing localized loading popup while it
generates the missing covers under one framebuffer loan, then performs one
final screen refresh. `Missing` is Activity-local, so leaving and reopening the
theme allows a failed cover to be retried.

On `BOARD_HAS_PSRAM` targets, Inx also keeps successfully validated thumbnail
BMP files in an Activity-local PSRAM cache. Entries are capped at 64 KB and the
cache at 512 KB; oversized files, allocation/read failures, and devices without
usable PSRAM continue through the same SD streaming path. The cache owns no new
on-disk format and is released when the Activity exits or its thumbnail height
changes.

All five Inx recent layouts select their thumbnail height through
`InxRecentActivity::setThumbnailHeight()`. S3 hardware builds with
`BOARD_HAS_PSRAM` use the actual drawn cover height (the center cover in Flow),
reducing rescaling after the existing 1-bit Atkinson conversion. C3 and
emulated builds retain `InxCoverGeometry::thumbnailHeightForCropFill()`.
The `thumb_<height>.bmp` names, conversion and fast-refresh policy are unchanged:
existing thumbnails remain valid when that height is requested, other heights
are generated on demand, and the legacy home-height fallback remains available.
Larger drawn covers still cannot recover detail absent from the source image.

TXT `index.bin` version 8 stores a partial or complete lazy page index, the
detected source encoding, and the paragraph-spacing mode. It is invalidated by
file-size, viewport, font, margin, alignment, or paragraph-spacing changes; see
[file-formats.md](../file-formats.md#txt-reader-cache) for its byte layout and
legacy-version invalidation behavior.

EPUB section versions 72/73 and TXT index version 8 invalidate older complete and
partial pagination because missing glyphs now occupy an ascender-scaled outline
box. Reopening a book rebuilds pagination automatically; metadata, chapter
indexes and source-offset reading progress are retained.

TXT `chapters.bin` version 1 is an optional source-offset chapter index built
the first time the chapter list opens. It is independent of pagination and is
invalidated by file size, encoding, or chapter-index version.

TXT `progress.bin` stores the current source offset so a chapter jump can be
restored without extending the page index through all intervening text. Legacy
four-byte page-number records remain readable.

**Hash**: `std::hash<std::string>{}(filepath)` → Moving/renaming file = new hash = lost progress

## Cache Invalidation Rules

**Cache is automatically invalidated when**:
1. **File format version changes** (see [../file-formats.md](../file-formats.md))
   - `book.bin` version number incremented
   - `section.bin` version number incremented
2. **Render settings change**:
   - Font family or size (`SETTINGS.fontFamily`, `SETTINGS.fontSize`)
   - Line spacing (`SETTINGS.lineSpacing`)
   - Paragraph spacing (`SETTINGS.extraParagraphSpacing`)
   - Screen margins (`SETTINGS.screenMargin`)
3. **Viewport dimensions change**:
   - Screen orientation change
   - Display resolution change
4. **Book file modified**:
   - Moved, renamed, or content changed (new hash)

Malformed caches are treated as misses. Readers validate every POD/string read,
length and lookup-table boundary before publishing parsed state. A truncated or
oversized `book.bin` is closed and removed; the current call returns no entry,
and the next normal EPUB load rebuilds it. This is a validation change only and
does not alter the version-11 binary layout.

**Manual Cache Clear** (safe operations):
```bash
# Delete ALL caches (forces full regeneration)
rm -rf /path/to/sd/.crosspoint/

# Delete specific book cache
rm -rf /path/to/sd/.crosspoint/epub_<hash>/

# Keep progress, delete only rendered sections
rm -rf /path/to/sd/.crosspoint/epub_<hash>/sections/
```

**When to Clear Cache**:
- EPUB parsing errors after code changes to `lib/Epub/`
- Corrupt rendering (missing text, wrong layout)
- Testing cache generation logic
- After modifying:
  - `lib/Epub/Epub/Section.cpp`
  - `lib/Epub/Epub/BookMetadataCache.cpp`
  - Render settings in `CrossPointSettings`

## Cache File Format Versioning

**Source**: `lib/Epub/Epub/Section.cpp`, `lib/Epub/Epub/BookMetadataCache.cpp`

**Current Versions** (as of [../file-formats.md](../file-formats.md)):
- `book.bin`: **Version 11** (metadata structure) — includes NFC-composed titles and ignores ambiguous EPUB guide text references while remaining above every version shipped by either lineage.
- `section.bin`: unified firmware uses **Version 57**. Version 56 was the former
  Latin flavor; selecting 57 invalidates pagination made with its different
  built-in font metrics.

**Version Increment Rules**:
1. **ALWAYS increment version** BEFORE changing binary structure
2. Version mismatch → Cache auto-invalidated and regenerated
3. Document format changes in [../file-formats.md](../file-formats.md)

**Example** (incrementing section format version):
```cpp
// lib/Epub/Epub/Section.cpp
static constexpr uint8_t SECTION_FILE_VERSION = 42;  // bump before any layout change

// Add new field to structure
struct PageLine {
  // ... existing fields ...
  uint16_t newField;  // New field added
};
```
