# Unified Firmware Chinese Support

> Deep reference for [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md): runtime content profiles,
> the compact embedded CJK fallback, and CJK font regeneration.

Every hardware target now builds one firmware. The base environment always
enables the existing CJK code paths. Selecting `Language::ZH_CN` uses
`ContentProfile::China`; every other language uses `ContentProfile::Global`.
The startup guide and later UI-language changes apply the same rule.

| Resource | Unified behavior |
|---|---|
| i18n | `gen_i18n.py` always emits all 33 languages. |
| UI fonts | International 8/10/12pt faces are primary; Simplified-Chinese subsets remain the built-in fallback. PSRAM-equipped S3 devices additionally use the selected SD family at matching sizes for multilingual missing glyphs. |
| Reader fonts | Only the 12pt CJK subset is an offline fallback. Complete families and other sizes use the existing `.cpfont` download/SD loader, one reader size resident at a time, plus optional S3 UI sizes. |
| EPUB/TXT | Unicode CJK parsing, line breaking and missing-glyph detection are always compiled and trigger from text content. |
| Apps | App visibility is independent of language and content profile. Language changes preserve app visibility choices. |
| Services | China uses `crossmux.cn`, OTA variant `cn`, and China NTP servers; Global uses `crossmux.com`, variant `global`, and international NTP servers. Initial onboarding alone sets the default UTC offset. |

**S3 UI fallback residency**

`SdCardFontSystem::setupUiFallbacks()` enables SD UI sizes only on real ESP32-S3
PSRAM targets with `memory::psramHasHeadroom(0, 0, 0)`. No-PSRAM unified builds
retain their previous one-reader-size policy, independently of UI language.
The renderer retains two ordered candidates per UI face: SD first, embedded
CJK second. Removing an SD font clears only that candidate, so network memory
release and failed font reloads cannot erase the built-in Chinese fallback.

At most three extra `.cpfont` instances live alongside the reader font; matching
reader/UI sizes share one instance. The manager reserves four tracking records
before loading. These fonts need dynamic, file-dependent coverage indices and
text caches across screens, so task-stack or static font buffers are unsuitable.
The existing file limits bound additional resident coverage indices to
`3 × 4 styles × 4096 intervals × 12 bytes = 576 KiB` (BMP-only indices use half).
This is the index ceiling, not total heap use: font objects and existing text
mini-caches also consume memory. Loading remains fallible. UI-only sizes do not
request another 1 MiB PSRAM glyph cache or flash preload. All are released by
the existing manager unload path.

Verify on S3 with an SD family containing 8/10/12pt files: check multilingual
file names, switch families, and enter/leave network features while observing
`SDMGR` load logs and free/largest internal heap blocks. Check a missing or corrupt
UI-size file still leaves Chinese UI usable. C3 must load no extra UI sizes.

**Flash budget** (default `partitions.csv`, dual A/B app slot = 6.25 MB):

| `gh_release` measurement (2026-09-17) | Image bytes | Slot headroom | Static RAM |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Before font storage changes | 6,371,040 B | 182,560 B | 65,444 B |
| Calculator font subset | 6,250,624 B | 302,976 B | 65,444 B |
| Plus shared CJK intervals | 6,190,080 B | 363,520 B | 65,444 B |

These are same-checkout `.bin` measurements, including image padding. The two
changes save 180,960 B (176.7 KiB) without changing supported CJK characters,
glyph bitmaps or metrics. Sharing the 2,523-entry Unicode index removes
60,552 B of duplicate data; the image shrinks by 60,544 B after alignment.
No new runtime allocations are introduced. The remaining 355 KiB headroom
is still below the 512 KiB release budget; a further 160,768 B must be removed
to reach that target. Physical X3/X4 display validation remains outstanding.

Sticky smoke test (2026-09-17): flashed the 5,796,752-byte `sticky` image
with write/hash verification. Wake, calculator rendering, return to the reader
and EPUB page turns were observed in serial logs; the tester confirmed normal
calculator display. The reader used an SD font, so this does not validate the
built-in 12pt CJK reader fallback. Dedicated 8/10/12pt visual checks remain
outstanding. Firmware SHA-256:
`f1bec28a4d10e5e87af9f25c484bad379831fd92be777465b2559c53bb5088d6`.

X3 smoke test (2026-09-17): rebuilt and flashed the 6,190,080-byte
`gh_release` image to ESP32-C3 MAC `70:af:09:5f:81:3c`; write/hash verification
passed. Font manifest loading failed after reboot (also confirmed by the tester):
both automatic and TLS 1.2 handshakes timed out, with only 3,024 / 3,652 bytes
of free heap respectively. After failure, free/minimum/largest-block heap was
15,892 / 2,568 / 10,740 bytes. This download check failed; reading/standby
comparison and physical font display checks remain pending. Local evidence:
`build/font-shrink-x3-upload.log` and `build/font-shrink-x3-test.log`.
Firmware SHA-256:
`e9d00e976050318937830126da43171b71f5494abeecfe5011019fa1c7d1124c`.

A/B OTA remains unchanged: both app slots are 6,553,600 bytes. Release builds
must stay at or below 6,029,312 bytes to retain at least 512 KiB headroom.

The unified build keeps LTO disabled. Combining LTO with the custom ESP-IDF core
rebuild previously allowed cache-critical SPI flash helpers to be linked into
Flash; calling them while cache was disabled caused an early-boot Cache Error.
Do not re-enable LTO without checking the final ELF and map for the affected
IRAM mappings.

The active size strategy is to embed only 8/10/12pt CJK subsets and externalize
large reading faces to `.cpfont`. This removes flash data without introducing a
decompression buffer or a new long-lived heap allocation.

## Regenerating the CJK fonts

The generator finishes by running `share-cn-font-intervals.py`. It validates
that the 8/10/12pt interval triples (first, last, glyph offset) are identical,
then writes `notosans_cjk_common_intervals.h` and references its single
`inline constexpr` table from those fonts. It refuses mismatches before writing.
To share indices in existing generated headers without rerasterizing fonts or
refreshing character sets, run:

```bash
python3 lib/EpdFont/scripts/share-cn-font-intervals.py
python3 lib/EpdFont/scripts/share-cn-font-intervals.py --check
```

```bash
# 1. (One-time) install build deps into a venv
python3 -m venv /tmp/cn_font_venv
/tmp/cn_font_venv/bin/pip install -r lib/EpdFont/scripts/requirements.txt

# 2. Place the official Noto Sans CJK SC Regular OTF into the source dir
#    (gitignored) under the filename expected by the script.
#    Source:
#    https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk/blob/main/Sans/OTF/SimplifiedChinese/NotoSansCJKsc-Regular.otf
cp /path/to/NotoSansSC-Regular.otf lib/EpdFont/builtinFonts/source/NotoSansSC/

# 3. (Optional) regenerate the character lists. build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh
#    calls this for you in Step 0 unless SKIP_CHARSET=1 is set.
#    Writes BOTH cn_common_chars.txt (top-N + require-from) and
#    cn_i18n_chars.txt (require-from only — drives the 14/16/18pt subset).
PYTHON=/tmp/cn_font_venv/bin/python3 \
  python3 lib/EpdFont/scripts/build_cn_charset.py \
    --require-from lib/I18n/translations/chinese.yaml

# 4. Generate the 6 per-size CJK headers
PYTHON=/tmp/cn_font_venv/bin/python3 \
  bash lib/EpdFont/scripts/build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh

# 5. Build the unified C3 firmware
pio run -e gh_release

# Build all six unified ESP32-S3 device binaries
pio run -e sticky -e x4pro -e papermono -e eego_a4 \
  -e murphy_m4 -e waveshare_epaper_397
```

Nightly builds and stores one neutrally named binary set per hardware target.
The legacy `global` and `zh-CN` schema-v1 manifests both reference that set;
publishing rejects a pair whose asset names, sizes, or SHA-256 values differ.
See [firmware-release.md](firmware-release.md) for the release and index contract.

The committed headers were regenerated with source SHA-256
`2c76254f6fc379fddfce0a7e84fb5385bb135d3e399294f6eeb6680d0365b74b`.
Verify a replacement source before regeneration: on the current committed
charset it must reproduce the existing glyph metrics and bitmap bytes. The
subset step deliberately excludes zero-width compatibility code point U+FFA0,
which is present in the official OTF but was absent from the previous source.

`build_cn_charset.py --top N` means "keep the top N characters from the base
pool, then add every required character." Required glyphs never displace base
glyphs, so output can contain more than N characters. `--top` may equal the
pool size but may not exceed it. The script rereads both generated files and
fails if a selected base or required character is missing.

## Force-including feature-specific glyphs

Each feature that needs CJK glyphs not already covered by the natural source
for the point size where it renders (the 3500-char pool at 8–12pt, or
`chinese.yaml` at 14/16/18pt) ships a small dedicated text file and adds it to
the `REQUIRE_FROM` array in
[build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh](../../lib/EpdFont/scripts/build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh).
`build_cn_charset.py --require-from <file>` regex-scans the complete file for
every CJK Unified Ideograph (`[一-鿿]`) and force-includes them in **both**
`cn_common_chars.txt` (8/10/12pt) and `cn_i18n_chars.txt` (14/16/18pt), so
glyphs added via this mechanism render at every CN font size.

Current example: [cn_almanac_chars.txt](../../lib/EpdFont/scripts/cn_almanac_chars.txt)
holds the extra chars `ChineseAlmanac.cpp` / `ChineseCalendarFace.cpp` need
for its ≤14pt rows and 18pt lunar row:

```text
戊庚壬癸寅卯巳酉戌廿蛰闰初七八九十冬腊
```

Pattern when adding a new feature:

1. Create `lib/EpdFont/scripts/cn_<feature>_chars.txt` containing only the
   CJK chars the feature renders that aren't otherwise covered (one line,
   UTF-8, no separators required).
2. Append that path to `REQUIRE_FROM=(... cn_<feature>_chars.txt)` in
   `build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh`.
3. Re-run `bash build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh` and commit the regenerated
   `cn_common_chars.txt`, `cn_i18n_chars.txt`, and six `notosans_cjk_*.h`.

Anti-pattern (don't do this): hiding chars in a `#` YAML comment inside
`chinese.yaml` to abuse the regex scanner. It works (build_cn_charset.py
does scan comments) but couples a font detail to the i18n file's structure
and forces `gen_i18n.py` to know about it. Dedicated `cn_*_chars.txt`
files are self-documenting and orthogonal to i18n.

## Expanding character coverage

`--top` is capped by the source pool size (`chars_3500_common.txt` has 3500
chars by construction — it is the vendored 教育部《现代汉语常用字表》).
Passing `--top 3500` keeps the complete pool; passing `--top 5000` fails.

To enlarge the renderable character set:

1. **For a handful of specific chars**: add a feature-scoped
   `cn_<feature>_chars.txt` as described above. One-line file + one-line
   append to `REQUIRE_FROM`. No pool expansion needed.
2. **For broad coverage gain** (e.g. classical literature, GB2312 Lv2): drop a
   larger source list into `lib/EpdFont/scripts/` (e.g. a `gb2312_full.txt`
   union of Lv1+Lv2) and point `SOURCE_FILE` in `build_cn_charset.py` at it.
   This is a deliberate Flash-budget decision — every 1000 extra chars adds
   roughly **380 KB** to the 8/10/12pt headers combined.

The hard ceiling is the 6.25 MiB A/B-OTA slot; the release gate reserves at
least 512 KiB, so broad pool expansion must be measured in the built image.

## Complete Chinese SD fonts

The unified firmware chooses the catalog host from the language-selected content profile:

```text
https://crossmux.cn/api/assets/fonts/m<manifest>-b<binary>/fonts.json
https://crossmux.com/api/assets/fonts/m<manifest>-b<binary>/fonts.json
```

Both catalogs are reached through CrossMux; firmware no longer selects GitHub
or Gitee directly. The returned manifest still supplies immutable asset URLs.

The version numbers come from the firmware's manifest and cpfont constants.
All catalogs must keep manifest v1 and referenced cpfont v4 assets consistent.
`baseUrl`, family/file names, non-zero file sizes, and CRC32 values must be
valid; the external catalog maintainer is responsible for complete Chinese
coverage.

The firmware offers the guided downloader when a built-in font is changed to
14/16/18pt, or when an EPUB scan sees a missing U+4E00–U+9FFF or
U+F900–U+FAFF glyph. The render task only records the first codepoint; the main
loop opens the activity. A reader session prompts once, and an active SD font
is never rechecked. The Text Settings prompt retains the ordinary **Manage
Fonts** flow. The EPUB prompt instead downloads and verifies the complete
`NotoSansSC` family, rejects a catalog without the exact current point size,
selects it without changing the point size, and silently restarts before loading
it. The clean boot supplies the contiguous heap required by the complete CJK
interval table, then runs the existing Flash preprocessing path and returns to
the same book and visible-text offset. Back and cancellation return there without
changing the selection; Home still routes to Home. Download and clean-boot load
errors remain on a Retry/Back page. A preprocessing failure keeps the verified
family, disables Flash preload, shows one notice, and continues from SD.

The manual manager still allows install/update/delete and batch downloads. A
single download selects that family and opens the text preview; **Download
All** prefers stable `NotoSansSC`, while **Update All** preserves the current
selection. In ordinary Text Settings entry, layout/style-only changes and font
changes later restored to their entry values skip preprocessing.

When `NotoSansSC` is discovered through download, web upload, or an SD-card
copy, it replaces the active built-in face and the built-in row is hidden. If
the family disappears, the existing missing-font fallback clears the SD
selection and the single built-in Noto Sans row becomes visible again. Legacy
Chinese settings that selected the duplicate built-in Serif ID migrate to the
Sans ID. Font sources and catalog-generation configuration remain outside this
repository.

## Known limitations

- **No bold/italic CJK glyphs**: the bitmaps come from a single NotoSansSC-Regular subset. The Settings page gives its four top-level Chinese category labels a fixed one-pixel synthetic bold; other UI elements that pass `EpdFontFamily::Style::Bold` render the regular weight under CN.
- **Offline reader fallback is 12pt only**: install an SD `.cpfont` family for other reading sizes and styles. The INX Settings categories also remain at the theme-defined 12pt because the unified firmware has no resident 16pt CJK UI face.
- **Rare characters render as □ in reader at SMALL until an SD font is installed**: the 12pt bitmap uses the complete 3500-char pool plus required glyphs. It omits classical/scientific rarities, Traditional Chinese variants, and uncommon names outside that set; for example, `璟` is intentionally absent. The reader offers the complete-font downloader on the first detected missing glyph.
- **No Traditional Chinese UI locale**: only `ZH_CN` is present; broader CJK book coverage depends on the selected SD font.

## Files

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `lib/EpdFont/scripts/build_cn_charset.py` | Rank the base pool by wordfreq Zipf, preserve its top-N, then add all required glyphs. Pool capped at `chars_3500_common.txt` size (3500). |
| `lib/EpdFont/scripts/chars_3500_common.txt` | Source pool — 现代汉语常用字表, 3500 chars (committed). To expand coverage, swap this file (see "Expanding character coverage"). |
| `lib/EpdFont/scripts/cn_common_chars.txt` | Generated common subset, drives 8/10/12pt (committed). Contains all 3500 base chars plus required additions; currently 3517 unique CJK chars. |
| `lib/EpdFont/scripts/cn_i18n_chars.txt` | Generated i18n-only subset, drives 14/16/18pt (committed). Contains every CJK char found in `--require-from` inputs. |
| `lib/EpdFont/scripts/build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh` | pyftsubset → fontconvert.py pipeline, six headers. Default re-runs `build_cn_charset.py`; set `SKIP_CHARSET=1` to reuse the current `cn_common_chars.txt`. The `REQUIRE_FROM=(...)` array at the top lists every file scanned for force-included CJK chars — add new feature-scoped `cn_*_chars.txt` files here. |
| `lib/EpdFont/scripts/cn_almanac_chars.txt` | Feature-scoped force-include for `ChineseAlmanac.cpp` / `ChineseCalendarFace.cpp` — ganzhi stems/branches missing from the common tier plus lunar-row vocabulary missing from the i18n tier. Single-line UTF-8. |
| `lib/EpdFont/builtinFonts/notosans_cjk_{8,10,12,14,16,18}.h` | Generated raw 2-bit bitmap headers (committed). Must match `cn_common_chars.txt` (8/10/12pt) and `cn_i18n_chars.txt` (14/16/18pt) — see consistency check below. |
| `lib/EpdFont/builtinFonts/source/NotoSansSC/` | OTF source dir (gitignored except for `.gitignore`). Drop `NotoSansSC-Regular.otf` here. |
| `lib/I18n/translations/chinese.yaml` | Simplified Chinese translations (`_language_code: ZH_CN`); also fed to `--require-from` so every CJK char in `STR_*: "value"` lines is forced into both subsets. Do **not** hide font-only chars in `#` comments — use a `cn_<feature>_chars.txt` file instead. |

## Consistency check

After regenerating, confirm the character lists and bitmap headers match:

- `cn_common_chars.txt` has 3517 unique CJK glyphs and contains the complete
  3500-char base pool.
- `cn_i18n_chars.txt` has 747 unique CJK glyphs and contains every glyph
  scanned from `chinese.yaml` and feature-specific files.
- 8/10/12pt each contain 4014 glyphs; 14/16/18pt each contain 1244 glyphs.
- Every generated header says `mode: 2-bit`.

Any assertion failure means a list or header is stale; re-run the regeneration
